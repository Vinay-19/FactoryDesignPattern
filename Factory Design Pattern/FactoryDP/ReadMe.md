#  Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will
be created. In iOS development, this pattern can be used to create objects of different types based on certain criteria.

Here's an example of how you can use the Factory Design Pattern in iOS development:

Suppose you have an app that allows users to purchase different types of products, such as books, clothes, and electronics. Each type of product has different
properties and methods associated with it. You want to create a ProductFactory class that will create objects of the appropriate type based on the user's
selection.
